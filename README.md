# Gxsm4 manual

This is the README.md for the MANUAL of GXSM4, the open source SPM solution.

The code is based on Stefan Schr√∂der's GXSM3-book which is available here: 

  ttps://github.com/StefanSchroeder/Gxsm3-book 

and earlier versions of GXSM.

The GXSM4 project is located here:

	https://github.com/pyzahl/Gxsm4

## Quick-Install

	# Download all the necessary packages (on debian-type systems)
	make prepare
	# Build the manual
	make
	# Open the manual
	make view 


## Gxsm-Manual

It contains _most_ of the files to generate the
PDF-manual for Gxsm (but not the plug-in documentation
which is embedded in the plug-ins).

Run 
	
	make prepare # to install build-dependencies
	make # to generate Gxsm-4.0-Manual.pdf
	make clean # to remove build-artifacts
	make view # to view the PDF
	make install # install the PDF to /usr/local

FIXME: HTML generation doesnt work 05/2015.
Run 'make html' to create a HTML version in 'html'.

The document is pretty sophisticated and requires a 
number of packages as dependencies. The bootstrap-scripts
should take care of retrieving all the necessary 
latex-packages. If your latex-distro is not supported,
please let us know in the forums. Please contribute
the instructions for your distro if you have been
able to figure the dependencies out yourself.
